# Potential Methods Information (was proposed solutions)?

Within the context of geographic data, of which the data this project uses resides, cluster analysis is seen as immensely useful in identifying groups of similar data points and performing detailed analysis of each group. [@tung2000geo] More specifically, K-means clustering is a fast algorithm used to perform the grouping of data points, excelling with large datasets. [@Jin2010] The K-means clustering algorithm works by taking an initial clustering of data points that is not optimal and relocates each point in the cluster to its new nearest center, then updates the clustering centers by finding the mean of the member points, iteratively following this process until the convergence criteria is met, which in most cases is the defined number of iterations. [@Jin2010] These kinds of algorithms and models can be applied to the geographic data in question to effectively model the same results that SAM and PVsyst produce. The benefit of this solution is that it only takes a few inputs to perform the analysis.
