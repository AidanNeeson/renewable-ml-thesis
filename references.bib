  abstract = {There is huge potential to increase installation of photovoltaics (PV) using the roofs of non-residential buildings. While barriers to and enablers of the adoption of PV in residential buildings are well studied, this is not the case for non-residential buildings. This article is intended to fill this research gap by mapping barriers to and enablers of PV adoption by property owners of non-residential buildings. This was done through a literature review and an empirical study in Sweden using a survey and semi-structured interviews. Common barriers identified in earlier research and in the present Swedish empirical study include economic, information/knowledge, and administrative/organizational barriers. New barriers identified in this Swedish study include building construction, lack of electricity storage, and tenants’ existing electricity supply contracts. Enablers identified in this Swedish and in earlier research include subsidies, environmental concerns, and expense reduction. The Swedish material also revealed enablers not mentioned in earlier studies, such as the opportunity to earn money and taking advantage of third-party ownership. Mapping barriers and enablers in research and in practice is an important step to understand why a wider diffusion is not happening. It is also important for developing new, creative ways of approaching companies and as a base when developing policy interventions. This study contributes to such a mapping for the non-residential sector.}

The availability and low cost of wind energy and its high efficiency and technological advancements make it one of the most promising renewable energy sources. Hence, capturing large amounts of wind energy is essential today. The large-scale integration of wind power sources must be evaluated and mitigated to develop a sustainable future power system. Wind energy research and the government are working together to overcome the potential barriers associated with its penetration into the power grid. This paper reviews the social, environmental, and cost-economic impacts of installing large-scale wind energy plants. A valuable review of wind energy technology and its challenges is also presented in this paper, including the effects of wind farms on nearby communities, generation uncertainty, power quality issues, angular and voltage stability, reactive power support, and fault ride-through capability. Besides, socioeconomic, environmental, and electricity market challenges due to the grid integration of wind power are also investigated. Finally, potential technical challenges to integrating large-scale wind energy into the power grid are reviewed regarding current research and their available mitigation techniques.},

To date, the surface area required for RE systems is greater than that for non-RE systems, exacerbating existing environmental policy challenges, from increasing land competition, to visual impacts. A suitable metric for comparing the extent of systems is the power density of electricity production, that is, the electrical power produced per horizontal m2 of surface area. This study systematically reviews power densities for 9 energy-types (wind, solar etc.) and multiple sub-types (e.g., for solar power: PV, solar thermal) in the United States. Median, mean, and uncertainty estimates are provided for 177 different densities from the literature. Non-renewable power densities are found to be three orders of magnitude larger than renewable densities. Natural gas and solar energy yield the highest median density per non-RE, and RE system respectively. Solar energy was the only system to experience a significant, positive relationship in power density over time. We apply these density estimates to NREL scenarios of future energy systems for state-specific assessments, and find that the largest growth in land use is in the southern United States.}

It further established an aspirational goal of 100% clean energy in all sectors by 2045. Achieving 60% to 70% or more in the electric sector is projected to be achievable at reasonable cost, if current planning assumptions prove true. However, getting all the way to the ideal 100% is a different matter, based on current technology projections, system configurations and costs. The challenges are two-fold. First, what to do with the renewables over-generation that will inevitably occur when necessarily large levels of installed and non-dispatchable renewable capacity produces in hours when there is no need for it? Second, without backup from fossil resources, reliability of the electric grid is a risk. Batteries have a bright future in helping integrate the intermittency of renewable resources on an hourly operating basis going forward. But at currently-projected storage durations and costs, the projected cost of using batteries to ensure installed resource adequacy and grid reliability in a 100% renewable, zero-fossil world is prohibitive without further technological advances and associated cost reductions. This article describes the unique challenges for California and potential solutions for them as the quest for 100% clean energy in California and other states continues.}

  This paper studies the impact of mining activity on socioeconomic outcomes in local communities in Peru. In the 1990s and 2000s, the value of Peruvian mining exports grew by 15times; and since the early 2000s, one-half of fiscal revenues from mining have been devolved to local governments. Has this boom benefitted people in local communities? Using the district-level “poverty map” of 2007 (the latest available with accurate data on consumption, poverty, and inequality) together with district-level data on mining production and fiscal transfers to local governments, we present some evidence to answer this question. We find that mining districts have larger average consumption per capita and lower poverty rates than otherwise similar districts. These positive impacts, however, decrease drastically with administrative and geographic distance from mining centers. Moreover, consumption inequality within mining districts is higher than in comparable nonproducing districts. This dual effect of mining is accounted for by, first, the better educated immigrants required and attracted by mining activity and, second, the jobs that some community natives obtain in industries and services related to mining. The inequalizing impact of mining, both across and within districts, may help explain the social discontent with mining in Peru, despite its enormous revenues. An area for future research highlighted in the paper regards the usefulness of fiscal transfers to local governments (the Mining Canon), a key component of the fiscal decentralization reform of 2002. We find neither a detrimental nor a beneficial effect from the Mining Canon in Peru. Whether this is explained by our early measurement of results (5years into the decentralization program) or by the lack of implementation capacity of local governments remains to be answered.}

The document is for potential users and others wanting to learn about the model's capabilities. SAM is a techno-economic computer model that calculates performance and financial metrics of renewable energy projects. Project developers, policy makers, equipment manufacturers, and researchers use graphs and tables of SAM results in the process of evaluating financial, technology, and incentive options for renewable energy projects. SAM simulates the performance of photovoltaic, concentrating solar power, solar water heating, wind, geothermal, biomass, and conventional power systems. The financial models are for projects that either buy and sell electricity at retail rates (residential and commercial) or sell electricity at a price determined in a power purchase agreement (PPA). SAM's simulation tools facilitate parametric and sensitivity analyses, Monte Carlo simulation and weather variability (P50/P90) studies. SAM can also read input variables from Microsoft Excel worksheets. For software developers, the SAM software development kit (SDK) makes it possible to use SAM simulation modules in their applications written in C/C plus plus, C sharp, Java, Python, MATLAB, and other languages. NREL provides both SAM and the SDK as free downloads at https://sam.nrel.gov. SAM is an open source project, so its source code is available to the public. Researchers can study the code to understand the model algorithms, and software programmers can contribute their own models and enhancements to the project. Technical support and more information about the software are available on the website.},

  ABSTRACT = {India has committed to reduce emissions with a goal to increase renewable energy production to 175 gigawatts (GW) by 2022. Achieving this objective will involve rapidly increasing the deployment of solar and wind energy, while at the same time addressing the related challenges of the financing requirements, environment impacts, and power grid integration. Developing energy on lands degraded by human activities rather than placing new infrastructure within natural habitats or areas of high production agriculture would reduce cumulative impacts and minimize land use conflicts. We estimated that converted lands have the potential capacity of 1789 GW across India, which is &gt;10 times the 2022 goals. At the same time, the total land footprint needed to meet India&rsquo;s 2022 renewable energy target is large, ranging from ~55,000 to 125,000 km2, which is roughly the size of Himachal Pradesh or Chhattisgarh, respectively. If renewable energy is advanced with the singular aim of maximizing resource potential, approximately 6700&ndash;11,900 km2 of forest land and 24,100&ndash;55,700 km2 of agricultural land could be impacted. Subsidies and incentive programs aimed at promoting low-impact renewable energy deployment and establishing mitigation obligations that raise costs for projects that create land-impacts could improve the public support for renewable energy.},

The goal of achieving energy neutrality through maximized use of on-site produced renewable energy and attaining optimal level of energy performance at building-cluster level requires reliable short term (resolution shorter than one day) energy demand predictions. However, the prediction and analysis of the energy performance of buildings is still focused on the individual building level and not on small neighborhood scale or building clusters. In a smart grid context, to better understand electricity consumption at different spatial levels, prediction should be at both individual as well as at building-cluster levels, especially for neighborhoods with definite boundaries (such as universities, hospitals). Therefore, in this paper, using data from 47 commercial buildings, a number of machine learning algorithms were evaluated to predict the electricity demand at individual building level and aggregated level in hourly intervals. Predicting at hourly granularity is important to understand short-term dynamics, yet most of the neighborhood scale studies are limited to yearly, monthly, weekly, or daily data resolutions. Two years of data were used in training the model and the prediction was performed using another year of untrained data. Learning algorithms such as; boosted-tree, random forest, SVM-linear, quadratic, cubic, fine-Gaussian as well as ANN were all analysed and tested for predicting the electricity demand of individual and groups of buildings. The results showed that boosted-tree, random forest, and ANN provided the best outcomes for prediction at hourly granularity when metrics such as computational time and error accuracy are compared.}

However, there is confusion about what exactly data science is, and this confusion could lead to disillusionment as the concept diffuses into meaningless buzz. In this article, we argue that there are good reasons why it has been hard to pin down exactly what is data science. One reason is that data science is intricately intertwined with other important concepts also of growing importance, such as big data and data-driven decision making. Another reason is the natural tendency to associate what a practitioner does with the definition of the practitioner's field; this can result in overlooking the fundamentals of the field. We believe that trying to define the boundaries of data science precisely is not of the utmost importance. We can debate the boundaries of the field in an academic setting, but in order for data science to serve business effectively, it is important (i) to understand its relationships to other important related concepts, and (ii) to begin to identify the fundamental principles underlying data science. Once we embrace (ii), we can much better understand and explain exactly what data science has to offer. Furthermore, only once we embrace (ii) should we be comfortable calling it data science. In this article, we present a perspective that addresses all these concepts. We close by offering, as examples, a partial list of fundamental principles underlying data science. }

The high variability of renewable generation makes forecasting critical for optimal balancing and dispatch of generation plants in a smarter grid. The challenge is to improve the accuracy and the confidence level of forecasts at a reasonable computational cost. Ensemble methods such as random forest (RF) and extra trees (ET) are well suited for predicting stochastic photovoltaic (PV) generation output as they reduce variance and bias by combining several machine learning techniques while improving the stability; i.e. generalisation capabilities. This paper investigated the accuracy, stability and computational cost of RF and ET for predicting hourly PV generation output, and compared their performance with support vector regression (SVR), a supervised machine learning technique. All developed models have comparable predictive power and are equally applicable for predicting hourly PV output. Despite their comparable predictive power, ET outperformed RF and SVR in terms of computational cost. The stability and algorithmic efficiency of ETs make them an ideal candidate for wider deployment in PV output forecasting.}

Given that energy consumption in buildings is influenced by aspects of urban form such as density and floor-area-ratios (FAR), understanding the distribution of energy intensities is critical for city planners. This paper presents a novel technique for estimating commercial building energy consumption from a small number of building features by training machine learning models on national data from the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). Our results show that gradient boosting regression models perform the best at predicting commercial building energy consumption, and can make predictions that are on average within a factor of 2 from the true energy consumption values (with an r2 score of 0.82). We validate our models using the New York City Local Law 84 energy consumption dataset, then apply them to the city of Atlanta to create aggregate energy consumption estimates. In general, the models developed only depend on five commonly accessible building and climate features, and can therefore be applied to diverse metropolitan areas in the United States and to other countries through replication of our methodology.}

This paper proposes a homogeneous ensemble approach, i.e., use of Random Forest (RF), for hourly building energy prediction. The approach was adopted to predict the hourly electricity usage of two educational buildings in North Central Florida. The RF models trained with different parameter settings were compared to investigate the impact of parameter setting on the prediction performance of the model. The results indicated that RF was not very sensitive to the number of variables (mtry) and using empirical mtry is preferable because it saves time and is more accurate. RF was compared with regression tree (RT) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to validate the superiority of RF in building energy prediction. The prediction performances of RF measured by performance index (PI) were 14–25% and 5–5.5% better than RT and SVR, respectively, indicating that RF was the best prediction model in the comparison. Moreover, an analysis based on the variable importance of RF was performed to identify the most influential features during different semesters. The results showed that the most influential features vary depending on the semester, indicating the existence of different operational conditions for the tested buildings. A further comparison between RF trained with yearly and monthly data indicated that the energy usage prediction for educational buildings could be improved by taking into consideration their energy behavior changes during different semesters.}

The objective of this study was to develop, for the first time, a model for prediction of energy loss in soil working machines using the datasets obtained from soil bin facility and a single-wheel tester. A total of 90 data points were derived from experimentations at five levels of wheel load (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 kN), six tire inflation pressure (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 kPa) and three forward velocities (0.7, 1.4 and 2 m/s). ANN (Artificial neural network) was used for modeling of obtained results compared to the forecasting ability of SVR (support vector regression) technique. Several statistical criterions, (i.e. MAPE (mean absolute percentage error), MSE (mean square error), MRE (mean relative error) and coefficient of determination (R2) were incorporated in the investigations. It was observed, on the basis of statistical criterions, that SVR-based generalized model outperformed ANN in modeling energy loss and exhibited its applicability as a promising tool in this domain.}

In order to keep this sector sustainable (diverse and productive over the time), energy planning should be carried out comprehensively and precisely. This paper describes the development of two types of numerical energy models which are able to predict the United States' future industrial energy-demand. One model uses an ANN (artificial neural network) technique, and the other model uses a MLR (multiple linear regression) technique. Various independent variables (GDP, price of energy carriers) are tested. The future industrial energy demand can then be forecasted based on a defined scenario. The ANN model anticipates a 16% increase in energy demand from 2012 by 2030. In this forecast, the model assumes that the effective independent parameters remain constant during this period and only GDP grows with a second-order polynomial trend. The forecast result, which shows consistency with published predictions, may be considered as an indication of the need for development of new and low-cost energy sources. This study suggests that the ANN technique is a reliable and powerful technique which can effectively perform input/output mapping. In order to validate the performance of the models, the results of the ANN model is compared to the projections from the Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy.}

The study answers this question by employing artificial neural networks (ANNs) to assess energy consumption and occupants' thermal comfort for any member of a building category. Two families of ANNs are generated: the first one addresses the existing building stock (as is), the second one addresses the renovated stock in presence of energy retrofit measures (ERMs). The ANNs are generated in MATLAB® by using the outcomes of EnergyPlus simulations as targets for networks' training and testing. A preliminary ‘Simulation-based Large-scale sensitivity/uncertainty Analysis of Building Energy performance’ (SLABE) is conducted to optimize the ANNs' generation. It allows to identify the networks' inputs and to properly select the ERMs. The developed ANNs can replace standard building performance simulation tools, thereby producing a substantial reduction of computational efforts and times. This can allow a wide diffusion of rigorous approaches for retrofit design, which are currently hampered by the excessive computational burden. As case study, office buildings built in South Italy during 1920–1970 are investigated. Comparing the ANNs' predictions with EnergyPlus targets, the regression coefficient is between 0.960 and 0.995 and the average relative error is between 2.0% and 11%.}

Indeed, it is reported in most statistical analyzes, and although it is not recommended as a final model selection tool, it provides an indication of the suitability of the chosen explanatory variables in predicting the response. In the classical setting, it is well known that the least-squares fit and coefficient of determination can be arbitrary and/or misleading in the presence of a single outlier. In many applied settings, the assumption of normality of the errors and the absence of outliers are difficult to establish. In these cases, robust procedures for estimation and inference in linear regression are available and provide a suitable alternative. In this paper we present a companion robust coefficient of determination that has several desirable properties not shared by others. It is robust to deviations from the specified regression model (like the presence of outliers), it is efficient if the errors are normally distributed, it does not make any assumption on the distribution of the explanatory variables (and therefore no assumption on the unconditional distribution of the responses). We also show that it is a consistent estimator of the population coefficient of determination. A simulation study and two real datasets support the appropriateness of this estimator, compared with classical (least-squares) and several previously proposed robust R2, even for small sample sizes.}

A density function, named the Approximate Root Normal Distribution (ARND), was developed to approximate the distribution of a square root of a normal random variable. This enabled approximating the distribution of the RMSE estimator. The theoretical derivations and the demonstrations on common distributions, a benchmark time series, and a real world data set (with prediction errors generated from ANN and ARIMA models) lead to the following practically useful findings. When comparing errors having the same distribution type, RMSE was shown to be preferred for platykurtic distributions, MAE for leptokurtic distributions, and either RMSE or MAE for mesokurtic distributions. For different distribution types, however, using the two estimators alone was shown to lead to erroneous conclusions. The revelation that the estimated RMSE/MSE ratio could identify whether the errors came from platykurtic/mesokurtic/leptokurtic distributions was a useful complementary result. Comparison of errors based on, error distributions, sample size and the standard errors of the estimators, was discussed. The proposed procedure for deriving the statistical properties of the two estimators has scope for extension for other distribution types.}

Conventional methods, which heavily rely on physical principles, have limited power in practice as their performance is subject to many physical assumptions. By contrast, data-driven methods have gained huge interests due to their flexibility in model development and the rich data available in modern buildings. The rapid development in data science has provided advanced data analytics to tackle prediction problems in a more convenient, efficient and effective way. This paper investigates the potential of one of the most promising techniques in advanced data analytics, i.e., deep learning, in predicting 24-h ahead building cooling load profiles. Deep learning refers to a collection of machine learning algorithms which are powerful in revealing nonlinear and complex patterns in big data. Deep learning can be used either in a supervised manner to develop prediction models with given inputs and output (i.e., cooling load), or in an unsupervised manner to extract meaningful features from raw data as model inputs. This study exploits the potential of deep learning in both manners, and compares its performance in cooling load prediction with typical feature extraction methods and popular prediction techniques in the building field. The results show that deep learning can enhance the performance of building cooling load prediction, especially when used in an unsupervised manner for constructing high-level features as model inputs. Using the features extracted by unsupervised deep learning as inputs for cooling load prediction can evidently enhance the prediction performance. The findings are enlightening and could bring more flexible and effective solutions for building energy predictions.}
