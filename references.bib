  abstract = {There is huge potential to increase installation of photovoltaics (PV) using the roofs of non-residential buildings. While barriers to and enablers of the adoption of PV in residential buildings are well studied, this is not the case for non-residential buildings. This article is intended to fill this research gap by mapping barriers to and enablers of PV adoption by property owners of non-residential buildings. This was done through a literature review and an empirical study in Sweden using a survey and semi-structured interviews. Common barriers identified in earlier research and in the present Swedish empirical study include economic, information/knowledge, and administrative/organizational barriers. New barriers identified in this Swedish study include building construction, lack of electricity storage, and tenants’ existing electricity supply contracts. Enablers identified in this Swedish and in earlier research include subsidies, environmental concerns, and expense reduction. The Swedish material also revealed enablers not mentioned in earlier studies, such as the opportunity to earn money and taking advantage of third-party ownership. Mapping barriers and enablers in research and in practice is an important step to understand why a wider diffusion is not happening. It is also important for developing new, creative ways of approaching companies and as a base when developing policy interventions. This study contributes to such a mapping for the non-residential sector.}

  abstract={Despite global warming, renewable energy has gained much interest worldwide due to its ability to generate large-scale energy without emitting greenhouse gases. The availability and low cost of wind energy and its high efficiency and technological advancements make it one of the most promising renewable energy sources. Hence, capturing large amounts of wind energy is essential today. The large-scale integration of wind power sources must be evaluated and mitigated to develop a sustainable future power system. Wind energy research and the government are working together to overcome the potential barriers associated with its penetration into the power grid. This paper reviews the social, environmental, and cost-economic impacts of installing large-scale wind energy plants. A valuable review of wind energy technology and its challenges is also presented in this paper, including the effects of wind farms on nearby communities, generation uncertainty, power quality issues, angular and voltage stability, reactive power support, and fault ride-through capability. Besides, socioeconomic, environmental, and electricity market challenges due to the grid integration of wind power are also investigated. Finally, potential technical challenges to integrating large-scale wind energy into the power grid are reviewed regarding current research and their available mitigation techniques.},

  abstract = {Energy systems are undergoing a significant shift to renewable energy (RE). To date, the surface area required for RE systems is greater than that for non-RE systems, exacerbating existing environmental policy challenges, from increasing land competition, to visual impacts. A suitable metric for comparing the extent of systems is the power density of electricity production, that is, the electrical power produced per horizontal m2 of surface area. This study systematically reviews power densities for 9 energy-types (wind, solar etc.) and multiple sub-types (e.g., for solar power: PV, solar thermal) in the United States. Median, mean, and uncertainty estimates are provided for 177 different densities from the literature. Non-renewable power densities are found to be three orders of magnitude larger than renewable densities. Natural gas and solar energy yield the highest median density per non-RE, and RE system respectively. Solar energy was the only system to experience a significant, positive relationship in power density over time. We apply these density estimates to NREL scenarios of future energy systems for state-specific assessments, and find that the largest growth in land use is in the southern United States.}

It is expressed in % of the utility’s total annual retail electricity sales. for electric utilities from 50% to 60% by 2030. It further established an aspirational goal of 100% clean energy in all sectors by 2045. Achieving 60% to 70% or more in the electric sector is projected to be achievable at reasonable cost, if current planning assumptions prove true. However, getting all the way to the ideal 100% is a different matter, based on current technology projections, system configurations and costs. The challenges are two-fold. First, what to do with the renewables over-generation that will inevitably occur when necessarily large levels of installed and non-dispatchable renewable capacity produces in hours when there is no need for it? Second, without backup from fossil resources, reliability of the electric grid is a risk. Batteries have a bright future in helping integrate the intermittency of renewable resources on an hourly operating basis going forward. But at currently-projected storage durations and costs, the projected cost of using batteries to ensure installed resource adequacy and grid reliability in a 100% renewable, zero-fossil world is prohibitive without further technological advances and associated cost reductions. This article describes the unique challenges for California and potential solutions for them as the quest for 100% clean energy in California and other states continues.}

Mining potentially influences 50 million km2 of Earth's land surface, with 8{\%} coinciding with Protected Areas, 7{\%} with Key Biodiversity Areas, and 16{\%} with Remaining Wilderness. Most mining areas (82{\%}) target materials needed for renewable energy production, and areas that overlap with Protected Areas and Remaining Wilderness contain a greater density of mines (our indicator of threat severity) compared to the overlapping mining areas that target other materials. Mining threats to biodiversity will increase as more mines target materials for renewable energy production and, without strategic planning, these new threats to biodiversity may surpass those averted by climate change mitigation.},

  abstract = {Summary
  This paper studies the impact of mining activity on socioeconomic outcomes in local communities in Peru. In the 1990s and 2000s, the value of Peruvian mining exports grew by 15times; and since the early 2000s, one-half of fiscal revenues from mining have been devolved to local governments. Has this boom benefitted people in local communities? Using the district-level “poverty map” of 2007 (the latest available with accurate data on consumption, poverty, and inequality) together with district-level data on mining production and fiscal transfers to local governments, we present some evidence to answer this question. We find that mining districts have larger average consumption per capita and lower poverty rates than otherwise similar districts. These positive impacts, however, decrease drastically with administrative and geographic distance from mining centers. Moreover, consumption inequality within mining districts is higher than in comparable nonproducing districts. This dual effect of mining is accounted for by, first, the better educated immigrants required and attracted by mining activity and, second, the jobs that some community natives obtain in industries and services related to mining. The inequalizing impact of mining, both across and within districts, may help explain the social discontent with mining in Peru, despite its enormous revenues. An area for future research highlighted in the paper regards the usefulness of fiscal transfers to local governments (the Mining Canon), a key component of the fiscal decentralization reform of 2002. We find neither a detrimental nor a beneficial effect from the Mining Canon in Peru. Whether this is explained by our early measurement of results (5years into the decentralization program) or by the lack of implementation capacity of local governments remains to be answered.}
